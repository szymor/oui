# OUI list

The repository contains OUI numbers assigned by IEEE to different organizations. The [original link](http://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui.txt) expired, so I reuploaded it on Github.

# Purpose
The list is used by the following Linux tools:
- [netdiscover](https://github.com/netdiscover-scanner/netdiscover)

Reach me out so I can update this list even further.
